# Windows Kernel Debugging

Binary Ninja debugger supports windows kernel debugging, either remote debugging using two machines, or local kernel debugging.
Below is the steps to configure it.

## Remote Kernel Debugging

At a high level, doing remote kernel debugging involves two steps: 1). setting up kernel debugging, 2). in Binary Ninja,
use the connection string to connect to it. There are multiple ways to configure Windows kernel debugging, and we will 
use kdnet as as example. Other configurations should be similar.

1. Setting up kernel debugging following the official [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/setting-up-a-network-debugging-connection-automatically). Below is a quick recap:
    - Copy `kdnet.exe` and `VerifiedNICList.xml` to the guest machine
    - Find out the host machine IP address and an available port
    - Ensure the network communication between the host and guest is smooth (e.g., check firewall settings)
    - On the guest machine, run `kdnet.exe <host_IP> <Port>` with administrative privilege, e.g., `kdnet.exe 192.168.56.1 50000`
    - `kdnet` will print out a windbg command line which contains the connection string, e.g., `windbg -k net:port=50000,key=m94cdr7mkd1g.2kr136s4s2gjn.g4fjk4arnn69.zjgk4tc396li`. Copy this to the host machine
2. Start up kernel debugging in Binary Ninja
    - Depending on your usage:
        - If you wish to debug code in a specific driver, open the file in Binary Ninja and analyze it, or
        - If you wish to debug the kernel in general, do not open any file, and create an empty binary view by pressing Ctrl+N/Command+N
    - Open debugger sidebar, click `Debug Adapter Settings` button, then
        - Set `Adapter Type` to `WINDOWS_KERNEL`
        - Set `Executable Path` to the kernel debugging connection string, e.g, `net:port=50000,key=m94cdr7mkd1g.2kr136s4s2gjn.g4fjk4arnn69.zjgk4tc396li`. Note, do not include the `windbg -k` part in it.
        - Click `Accept`
    - Click the `Launch` button to start kernel debugging
    - The debugger asks you to confirm the launch operation. Click `Yes` to proceed
    - If you did not open a file in the first step, the debugger asks you to specify the platform for the debugger binary view. Select `windows-kernel-x86_64` or `windows-kernel-x86` accordingly. Click `Accept` to proceed
    - The debugger will now connect to the guest machine. In the `Debugger Console`, it should print something similar to thisï¼š
    ```

    Using NET for debugging
    Opened WinSock 2.0
    Waiting to reconnect...
    ```

3. Finalizing the setup
    - Reboot the guest machine by running `shutdown -r -t 0` in the guest command prompt
    - The guest machine will then reboot and connect to the debugger
    - We will see somethng similar to this in the `Debugger Console` in Binary Ninja:

    ```
    Connected to target 192.168.56.1 on port 50000 on local IP 192.168.56.1.

    *   You are seeing this message because you pressed either                    *

    * If you did not intend to break into the debugger, press the "g" key, then   *
    * press the "Enter" key now.  This message might immediately reappear.  If it *
    * does, press "g" and "Enter" again.                                          *
    *                                                                             *
    *******************************************************************************
    ```

    - Wait for a short while for the guest to boot, and it will break into the debugger:

    ```
    Break instruction exception - code 80000003 (first chance)
    nt!KiInitializeMTRR+0x36512:
    fffff801`7e281e36 cc              int     3
    ```

    - (Optional) If you wish to debug the early boot phase, place the appropriate breakpoint(s) using the WinDbg command line in the console
    - Press the `Go` button in the debugger sidebar or type `g` in the debugger console to resume the target
    - The guest should continue to boot and enter the desktop
        - This might be slower compared to a regular boot process since the system is being debugged
        - During this process, the guest may break into the debugger a few more times. This is normal for kernel debugging. Just resume the target and let it run
    - If you have opened a driver file earlier, when it gets load, the debugger breaks at its `DriverEntry`
    - If you did not open a driver file, once the guest boots into the desktop, click the `Pause` button to break into the debugger
    - Proceed with the debugging as you would like to!
   

## Local Kernel Debugging

1. Run Binary Ninja with administrative privilege
2. Create a new empty binary view by pressing Ctrl+N/Command+N
3. Open debugger sidebar, click `Debug Adapter Settings`
4. Select `LOCAL_WINDOWS_KERNEL` as the adapter type. Click `Accept`
5. Click the `Launch` button to start local kernel debugging
6. The `Debugger Console` should print something similar to this:
```

7. Proceed with the debugging as you would like to!

## Troubleshooting & Known Issues

1. Running certain commands that takes a while to complete can lead to a [brief hang](https://github.com/Vector35/debugger/issues/532)
2. When we end the remote kernel debugging, the guest system is [always paused](https://github.com/Vector35/debugger/issues/533)
3. Once we have enabled kernel debugging with `kdnet`, the system will always wait for a kernel debugger to connect during boot.
It would hang if we do not attach a kernel debugger, even if we do not plan to do kernel debugging at all.
To avoid this, I highly recommend taking a snapshot of the VM before attempting to do kernel debugging.
If you know there is a way to reset the kernel debugging status and let the system boot in the normal way, please let me know!
