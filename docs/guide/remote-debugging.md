## Debug Server v.s. Remote Process

There are two types of remote debugging: via a `debug server` or a `remote process`.

A remote process is straightforward -- it is a process that runs on the remote host. The debugger connects to it and then debugs it. If you have used `gdbserver` or `debugserver` previously, you probably already know about it.

A debug server is a server that runs on the remote host. The debugger connects to it and can instruct the debug server to launch a process as needed. Then the debugger can connect to the running process and debug it.
One advantage of using a debug server is that the user does not need to access the remote host to launch the target repeatedly‚Äîthis can be done within the debugger.
Moreover, a debug server often offers more functionalities than launching a remote process. For example, the `lldb-server` supports reading and writing the remote file system, as well as executing shell commands on the remote host.

We recommend using a debug server whenever possible and only use the remote process as a backup.

For now, `DbgEng` adapter supports debug server, and `LLDB` adapter supports both debug server and remote process.

## Windows Remote Debugging

This section explains how to remotely debug a process running on Windows. Right now this is only possible to do from
another Windows machine. We know this is a highly useful feature to be able to do so from Linux or macOS, and please
feel free to track our progress:
[issue 1](https://github.com/Vector35/debugger/issues/70), [issue 2](https://github.com/Vector35/debugger/issues/613).

### Preparing the Remote Host

- Download or copy [debugger-win32.zip](https://github.com/Vector35/debugger/releases/download/1.0/debugger-win32.zip)
  to the remote host
- Extract it

### Launching the Debug Server

To start a remote debugging session, launch the `dbgsrv.exe` on the remote machine as described below:

- Determine whether the target program is x64 or x86
    - If the target is x64, then use the `dbgsrv.exe` in `debugger-win32\plugins\dbgeng\amd64`
    - If the target is x86, then use the `dbgsrv.exe` in `debugger-win32\plugins\dbgeng\x86`
    - If the version of `dbgsrv.exe` does not match the program, the debugger will behave unexpectedly
- Launch the dbgsrv by running `dbgsrv.exe -t tcp:port=<PORT>,server=<IP_ADDRESS>`
    - `IP_ADDRESS:PORT` is the IP and port the Binary Ninja will later connect to
    - For example, `dbgsrv.exe -t tcp:port=12345,server=192.168.72.25`
    - Note, the `server=` part cannot be omitted.
- If this is done for the first time, the Windows firewall will pop up a confirmation dialog. Allow the operation.
- If the operation succeeds, the `dbgsrv.exe` will keep running in the background. If any error occurs, it will show a
  message box.
- If the target program requires Administrative privilege to run, run `dbgsrv.exe` from a command prompt with
  Administrative privilege


### Connecting to the Debug Server

Now, connect to a debug server in Binary Ninja using DbgEng adapter.

- Open the binary you wish to debug
- Click "Debugger" -> "Connect to Debug Server" in the main window menu bar
- In the dialog, type in the IP and port to connect to:

![](../../img/debugger/debugserver.png)

- Click `Accept`. A message box will show up if the connection is successful

Now you can launch or connect to a process on the remote host. It works similarly as if you launch or attach to
a process locally.

### Launching a Process on the Remote Host

- Click "Debugger" -> "Debug Adapter Settings..." in the main window menu bar

![](../../img/debugger/remoteadaptersettings.png)

- Specify the executable path and working directory on the remote machine. This is likely different from the local path
  which is shown by default
- Launch the target

### Attaching to a Process on the Remote Host

- Click "Debugger" -> "Attach To Process..." in the menu bar
- Select the process to attach to
- If the process is not listed, you might need to run `dbgsrv.exe` with Administrator privilege
- Click "Attach" to attach to the process and start debugging

When connected to the debug server, the debugger can launch or connect to a process multiple times using the same
connection. There is no need to relaunch and reconnect to the debug server after the target exits.

To disconnect from the debug server, click "Debugger" -> "Disconnect from Debug Server". After that, if we launch the
target, it will execute on the local machine. Be careful!


## Linux Remote Debugging (Using Debug Server)

This section explains how to remotely debug a process running on Linux. This can be done from all platforms, i.e.,
Windows, Linux, and macOS.

There are two ways to do Linux remote debugging, i.e., using a debug server or a remote process. Debug server is the
recommended way. However, if it does not work for you, you can try using the remote process approach or using
`gdbserver`, which are documented later.

### Preparing the Remote Host

- Download or copy [debugger-linux.zip](https://github.com/Vector35/debugger/releases/download/1.0/debugger-linux.zip)
  to the remote host
- Extract it
- One can also use the `lldb-server` that can be installed via a package manager. However, it may have compatibility
  issues.

### Launching the Debug Server

- `cd debugger-linux/plugins/lldb`
- `./lldb-server p --server --listen 0.0.0.0:31337`

Specifying `0.0.0.0` instructs lldb-server to listen on all interfaces. You can also specify a particular IP address of
an interface that the Binary Ninja debugger will later connect to.


### Connecting to the Debug Server

- Open the binary you wish to debug
- Click "Debugger" -> "Connect to Debug Server" in the main window menu bar
- In the dialog, type in the IP and port to connect to:

![](../../img/debugger/debugserver-lldb.png)

- There is a `Platform` dropdown menu. Select `remote-linux` in it

![](../../img/debugger/platform-list.png)

- Click `Accept`. A message box will show up if the connection is successful.

### Launching a Process on the Remote Host

- Open the `Debug Adapter Settings` dialog
- Set the `Working Directory` to the *remote* directory that you wish to launch the process in. Do not leave the path
  unchanged since it will then be a local path, and there will be an error during launch.
- Do NOT change the `Executable Path` to a remote path. Set it to the local path where the executable is in. During
  launch, LLDB will copy the executable to the remote host, put it in the working directory we supplied above, and
  launch it. Setting a remote path here will cause errors. LLDB is smart enough to check the hash of the file so that it
  will only copy the file once.
- Launch the target

### Attaching to a Process on the Remote Host

- Click "Debugger" -> "Attach To Process..." in the menu bar
- Select the process to attach to
- If the process is not listed, you might need to run `lldb-server` with sudo
- Click "Attach" to attach to the process

When connected to the debug server, the debugger can launch the executable multiple times using the same connection. There is no need to relaunch and reconnect to the debug server after the target exits.

To disconnect from the debug server, click "Debugger" -> "Disconnect from Debug Server". After that, if we launch the target, it will execute on the local machine. Be careful!



## Linux Remote Debugging (using Remote Process)

If the debug server does not work, you can try Linux remote debugging via the remote process approach. This uses
`lldb-server` in GDB mode and might be simpler to configure.

### Preparing the Remote Host

- Download or copy [debugger-linux.zip](https://github.com/Vector35/debugger/releases/download/1.0/debugger-linux.zip)
  to the remote host
- Extract it
- One can also use the `lldb-server` that can be installed via a package manager. However, it may have compatibility
  issues.

### Launching or Attaching to a Remote Process

- `cd debugger-linux/plugins/lldb`
- To launch a new process, run `./lldb-server g 0.0.0.0:31337 -- /path/to/helloworld foo bar`
    - `/path/to/helloworld` is the path of the executable
    - `foo bar` are two arguments
- To attach to a running process by PID, run `./lldb-server g 0.0.0.0:31337 --attach 1234`
    - `1234` is the PID of the target process

Specifying `0.0.0.0` instructs lldb-server to listen on all interfaces. You can also specify a particular IP address of
an interface that the Binary Ninja debugger will later connect to.


### Connecting to the Remote Process

- Open the binary you wish to debug
- Click "Debugger" -> "Connect to Remote Process" in the main window menu bar
- In the dialog, type in the IP and port to connect to:

![](../../img/debugger/remoteprocess.png)

- For the `Plugin` dropdown menu, select `gdb-remote` accordingly.
- Click `Accept`.
- The debugger will now connect to the process launched or attached to in the previous step and start debugging

When using the remote process mode, when the debugging stops (the target exits or gets killed), the connection is
automatically closed. There is no extra steps needed to close the connection.

If you wish to debug the target again, you will need to repeat the steps above to launch or attach to a remote process.





## MacOS Remote Debugging (Using Debug Server)

This section explains how to remotely debug a process running on MacOS. This can be done from all platforms, i.e.,
Windows, Linux, and macOS.

There are two ways to do MacOS remote debugging, i.e., using a debug server or a remote process. Debug server is the
recommended way. However, if it does not work for you, you can try using the remote process approach documented below.

### Preparing the Remote Host

  to the remote host
- Extract it


### Launching the Debug Server

- `cd debugger-darwin/plugins/lldb`
- `./lldb-server p --server --listen 0.0.0.0:31337`

Specifying `0.0.0.0` instructs lldb-server to listen on all interfaces. You can also specify a particular IP address of
an interface that Binary Ninja debugger will later connect to.


### Connecting to the Debug Server

- Open the binary you wish to debug
- Click "Debugger" -> "Connect to Debug Server" in the main window menu bar

![](../../img/debugger/platform-list.png)

- Click `Accept`. A message box will show up if the connection is successful.

### Launching a Process on the Remote Host

- Open the `Debug Adapter Settings` dialog
- Set the `Working Directory` to the *remote* directory that you wish to launch the process in. Do not leave the path
  unchanged since it will then be a local path, and there will be an error during launch.
- Do NOT change the `Executable Path` to a remote path. Set it to the local path where the executable is in. During

- To launch a new process, run `./lldb-server g 0.0.0.0:31337 -- /path/to/helloworld foo bar`
    - `/path/to/helloworld` is the path of the executable
    - `foo bar` are two arguments
- To attach to a running process by PID, run `./lldb-server g 0.0.0.0:31337 --attach 1234`

- The debugger will now connect to the process launched or attached to in the previous step and start debugging

When using the remote process mode, when the debugging stops (the target exits or gets killed), the connection is
automatically closed. There is no extra steps needed to close the connection.

If you wish to debug the target again, you will need to repeat the steps above to launch or attach to a remote process.



## GDB Server Remote Debugging

GDB server is a widely used mechanism for remote debugging. On Linux systems, there is a `gdbserver` executable that can
be installed and executed. Many other projects, e.g., QEMU, also include a gdb stub that speaks the same protocol.

Please note that although the "GDB server" has a "server" in its name, normally it operates as a remote process. In other
words, the debugging is one-shot, that when the target exits, the connection gets closed. If you wish to debug it
again, you need to start the GDB server again.

### Launching GDB Server

- On Linux, to launch a new process, run `gdbserver 0.0.0.0:31337 -- /path/to/helloworld foo bar`
    - `/path/to/helloworld` is the path of the executable
    - `foo bar` are two arguments
- On Linux, to attach to a running process by PID, run `gdbserver 0.0.0.0:31337 --attach 1234`
    - `1234` is the PID of the target process
- For QEMU, add `-s -S` to the command line
    - For example, `qemu-system-x86_64 -drive file=disk.img,format=raw -bios bios.bin -s -S`
    - `-s` starts QEMU with a GDB server listening on TCP port 1234
    - `-S` starts QEMU in a paused state, allowing you to connect with GDB before the virtual CPU starts executing
    - You can specify a different port to listen on by replacing `-s` with `-gdb tcp::port`
- For other tools that also speak the GDB remote debugging protocol, please refer to their documentation on how to
  configure it


### Connecting to GDB Server

- Open the binary you wish to debug
- Click "Debugger" -> "Connect to Remote Process" in the main window menu bar
- In the dialog, type in the IP and port to connect to:

![](../../img/debugger/remoteprocess.png)

- For the `Plugin` dropdown menu, select `gdb-remote` accordingly.
- Click `Accept`.
- The debugger will now connect to the process launched or attached to in the previous step and start debugging

Recent versions of the GDB server also support a debug server mode, which can be active using
`gdbserver --multi 0.0.0.0:31337`. However, the Binary Ninja debugger does not yet support connecting to the GDB server in
this mode.




## iOS Remote Debugging

Binary Ninja debugger supports debugging an iOS app running on a real device or an emulator. The process is
similar to macOS remote debugging, except that we need to run `debugserver` on the device rather than `lldb-server`.

### Preparation

Setting up an iOS device or emulator for debugging is challenging. A step-by-step guide is out of scope here.
We assume the user can already debug an iOS app using the LLDB command line and wish to debug it within the Binary Ninja
debugger.

The high-level steps are:

- Get SSH access to the device. This can be done by either jailbreaking the device or using an emulator
- Extract the `debugserver` executable from the developer disk image that comes with the XCode
- Sign it with a proper entitlements plist to enable it to debug all processes
- Upload the signed `debugserver` to the remote system


### Launching or Attaching to the target

- SSH into the remote host
- To launch a new process, run `./debugserver 0.0.0.0:31337 /path/to/helloworld foo bar`
    - `/path/to/helloworld` is the path of the executable
    - `foo bar` are two arguments
- To attach to a running process by PID, run `./debugserver 0.0.0.0:31337 --attach=1234`
    - `1234` is the PID of the target process


### Connecting to the target

- Open the binary you wish to debug
- Click "Debugger" -> "Connect to Debug Server" in the main window menu bar
- In the dialog, type in the IP and port entered in the previous step:

![](../../img/debugger/remoteprocess.png)

- For the `Plugin` dropdown menu, select `debugserver/lldb`
- Click `Accept`.




## Android Remote Debugging

Binary Ninja debugger supports debugging an Android app running on a real device or an emulator. The process is
similar to GDB server remote debugging.

### Preparation

Setting up an Android device or emulator for debugging requires a few steps. A step-by-step guide is out of scope here.
We assume the user can already debug an Android app using the GDB command line and wish to debug it within the Binary
Ninja debugger.

The high-level steps are:

- Get SSH access to the device. This can be done by either rooting a real device or using an emulator
- Install the Android NDK on your computer
- Find the `gdbserver` or `gdbserver64` executable in NDK
- Upload it to the remote host


### Launching or Attaching to the target

- SSH into the remote host
- To launch a new process, run `gdbserver 0.0.0.0:31337 -- /path/to/helloworld foo bar`
    - `/path/to/helloworld` is the path of the executable
    - `foo bar` are two arguments
- To attach to a running process by PID, run `gdbserver 0.0.0.0:31337 --attach 1234`
    - `1234` is the PID of the target process


### Connecting to the target

- Open the binary you wish to debug
- Click "Debugger" -> "Connect to Debug Server" in the main window menu bar
- In the dialog, type in the IP and port entered in the previous step:

![](../../img/debugger/remoteprocess.png)

- For the `Plugin` dropdown menu, select `gdb-remote`
- Click `Accept`.
